We show that the concept of process is more complex and subtle than presented so far and in fact embodies two separate and potentially independent concepts: one relat-ing to resource ownership, and another relating to execution. This distinction has led to the development, in many operating systems, of a construct known as the thread.\n 4. 1 PR OCESSES AND THREADS\nThe discussion so far has presented the concept of a process as embodying two characteristics:\n1.\n R\nesource ownership: A process includes a virtual address space to hold the \nprocess image;\u00a0recall from Chapter 3 that the process image is the collection of program, data, stack, and attributes defined in the process control block. From time to time, a process may be allocated control or ownership of resources, such as main memory, I/O", "doc_id": "73004b4f-eb23-41b3-bfad-aae2311a0c8f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2648dd24182221e48c0aeaa4e3fc0ab432e989ffc5b1b7f4ab8a16cda6ce1713", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 44652, "end": 45658}, "relationships": {"1": "0b3769a0-44f5-4246-a849-fd4f973fc462", "2": "2d65a012-620b-4480-b554-28e618a59cfc", "3": "592e8bc8-6f53-45a6-9359-41d9026b7f4b"}, "__type__": "1"}, "592e8bc8-6f53-45a6-9359-41d9026b7f4b": {"text": "process may be allocated control or ownership of resources, such as main memory, I/O channels, I/O devices, and files. The OS performs a protection function to prevent unwanted interference between processes with respect to resources.\n2.\n Scheduling/e\nxecution: The execution of a process follows an execution path \n(trace) through one or more programs \u00a0(e.g., Figure 1.5). This execution may \nbe interleaved with that of other processes. Thus, a process has an execution state (Running, Ready, etc.) and a dispatching priority, and is the entity that is scheduled and dispatched by the OS.\nSome thought should convince the reader that these two characteristics are \nindependent and could be treated independently by the OS. This is done in a number \nof operating systems, particularly recently developed systems.

Because a server will handle many requests, many threads will be created and destroyed in a short period. If the server runs on a multiprocessor computer, then multiple threads within the same process can be executing simultaneously on different processors. Further, because processes or threads in a file server must share file data and therefore coordinate their actions, it is faster to use threads and shared memory than processes and message passing for this coordination.\nThe thread construct is also useful on a single processor to simplify the structure \nof a program that is logically doing several different functions.\n[LETW88] gives four examples of the uses of threads in a single-user multipro-\ncessing system:\n1.\n F\noreground and background work: For example, in a spreadsheet program, one", "doc_id": "f365e7a1-c8d9-4f4e-aefd-f4451d62b3f8", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "be5d3f13505dd8bb27dceb4c22f9cf1fbe38b2edb80c6d7e7996ae1c7216da62", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 58216, "end": 59305}, "relationships": {"1": "0b3769a0-44f5-4246-a849-fd4f973fc462", "2": "8a4592e6-2f6b-4a58-a8d6-63e13c70e2d3", "3": "863567a0-fae7-4f6b-a254-574bb2b87cb2"}, "__type__": "1"}, "863567a0-fae7-4f6b-a254-574bb2b87cb2": {"text": "F\noreground and background work: For example, in a spreadsheet program, one \nthread could display menus and read user input, while another thread executes user commands and updates the spreadsheet.

We show that the concept of process is more complex and subtle than presented so far and in fact embodies two separate and potentially independent concepts: one relat-ing to resource ownership, and another relating to execution. This distinction has led to the development, in many operating systems, of a construct known as the thread.\n 4. 1 PR OCESSES AND THREADS\nThe discussion so far has presented the concept of a process as embodying two characteristics:\n1.\n R\nesource ownership: A process includes a virtual address space to hold the \nprocess image;\u00a0recall from Chapter 3 that the process image is the collection of program, data, stack, and attributes defined in the process control block. From time to time, a process may be allocated control or ownership of resources, such as main memory, I/O", "doc_id": "bd50bfab-fee6-4295-b5da-8b6c168ebb9b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bc8219a88b2f4d18b875bf16bcf66bca302c48c7cc61532d122febca4cb05d3b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1915}, "relationships": {"1": "aebb7a33-e82a-4ead-b5c0-990d48abd038", "3": "0b369bf2-ea1b-4962-badd-5fcd6e4e8416"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b369bf2-ea1b-4962-badd-5fcd6e4e8416": {"text": "process may be allocated control or ownership of resources, such as main memory, I/O channels, I/O devices, and files. The OS performs a protection function to prevent unwanted interference between processes with respect to resources.\n2.\n Scheduling/e\nxecution: The execution of a process follows an execution path \n(trace) through one or more programs \u00a0(e.g., Figure 1.5). This execution may \nbe interleaved with that of other processes. Thus, a process has an execution state (Running, Ready, etc.) and a dispatching priority, and is the entity that is scheduled and dispatched by the OS.\nSome thought should convince the reader that these two characteristics are \nindependent and could be treated independently by the OS. This is done in a number \nof operating systems, particularly recently developed systems. To distinguish the two characteristics, the unit of dispatching is usually referred to as a thread or Learning  Objectives\nAfter studying this chapter, you should be able to:\n\u2022\tUnderstand the distinction between process and thread.\n\u2022\tDescribe the basic design issues for threads.\n\u2022\tExplain the difference between user-level threads and kernel-level threads.\n\u2022\tDescribe the thread management facility in Windows.\n\u2022\tDescribe the thread management facility in Solaris.\n\u2022\tDescribe the thread management facility in Linux.\nM04_STAL4290_09_GE_C04.indd   177 5/2/17   4:38 PM\n178  CHAPTER  4 / T HREADS\nlightweight\u00a0process, while the unit of resource ownership is usually referred to as a \nprocess or task.1\nMultithreading\nMultithreading refers to the ability of an OS to support multiple, concurrent paths of execution within a single process. The traditional approach of a single thread of execution per process, in which the concept of a thread is not recognized, is referred to as a single-threaded approach. The two arrangements shown in the left half of Figure 4.1 are single-threaded approaches.

Also, in the literature, the term lightweight process is used as either (1)\u00a0equiva-lent to the term thread, (2) a particular type of thread known as a kernel-level thread, or (3) in the case of Solaris, an entity that maps user-level threads to kernel-level threads.Figure 4.1  Thr eads and ProcessesOne process\nOne threadOne process\nMultiple threads\nMultiple processes\nOne thread per process\n= Instruction traceMultiple processes\nMultiple threads per process\nM04_STAL4290_09_GE_C04.indd   178 5/2/17   4:38 PM\n182  CHAPTER  4 / T HREADS\nA significant issue is whether the blocking of a thread results in the blocking \nof the entire process. In other words, if one thread in a process is blocked, does this \nprevent the running of any other thread in the same process, even if that other thread is in a ready state? Clearly, some of the flexibility and power of threads is lost if the one blocked thread blocks an entire process.\nWe will return to this issue subsequently in our discussion of user-level versus \nkernel-level threads, but for now, let us consider the performance benefits of threads that do not block an entire process.

Figure 4.3 (based on one in [KLEI96]) shows a program that performs two remote procedure calls (RPCs)\n2 to two different hosts to \nobtain a combined result. In a single-threaded program, the results are obtained in sequence, so the program has to wait for a response from each server in turn. Rewrit-ing the program to use a separate thread for each RPC results in a substantial speedup. Note if this program operates on a uniprocessor, the requests must be gener -\nated sequentially and the results processed in sequence; however, the program waits concurrently for the two replies.\n2An RPC is a technique by which two programs, which may execute on different machines, interact using \nprocedure call/return syntax and semantics. Both the called and calling programs behave as if the partner \nprogram were running on the same machine. RPCs are often used for client/server applications\u00a0and will be discussed in Chapter 16 .Figure 4.3  R emote Procedure Call (RPC) Using Threads(a) RPC using single thread\n(b) RPC using one thread per server (on a uniprocessor)Time\nProcess 1\nBlocked, waiting for response to RPC\nBlocked, waiting for processor, which is in use by Thread B\nRunningThread A (Process 1)\nThread B (Process 1)Server Server\nServer\nServerRPC\nrequest\nRPC\nrequest\nRPC\nrequestRPC\nrequest\nM04_STAL4290_09_GE_C04.indd   182 5/2/17   4:38 PM\n4.2 / TYPES OF THREADS   183\nOn a uniprocessor, multiprogramming enables the interleaving of multiple \nthreads within multiple processes. In the example of Figure 4.4, three threads in two \nprocesses are interleaved on the processor.

Any alteration of a resource by one thread affects the environment of the other threads in the same process. It is therefore necessary to synchronize the activities of the various threads so that they do not interfere with each other or corrupt data structures. For example, if two threads each try to add an element to a doubly linked list at the same time, one element may be lost or the list may end up malformed.\nThe issues raised and the techniques used in the synchronization of threads \nare, in general, the same as for the synchronization of processes.\u00a0These issues and techniques will be the subject of Chapters 5 and 6.\n 4. 2 TYPES OF THREADS\nUser-Level and Kernel-Level Threads\nThere are two broad categories of thread implementation: user-level threads (ULTs) and kernel-level threads (KLTs).\n4 The latter are also referred to in the literature as \nkernel-supported threads or lightweight processes.\nUSer-Leve L Thread S In a pure ULT facility, all of the work of thread management \nis done by the application and the kernel is not aware of the existence of threads. \n3In this example, thread C begins to run after thread A exhausts its time quantum, even though thread B \nis also ready to run. The choice between B and C is a scheduling decision, a topic covered in Part Four.\n4The acronyms ULT and KLT are not widely used, but are introduced for conciseness.Figure 4.4  Multithr eading Example on a UniprocessorTime\nBlockedI/O\nrequest\nThread A (Process 1)\nThread B (Process 1)\nThread C (Process 2)\nReady RunningRequest\ncompleteTime quantum\nexpires\nTime quantum\nexpires\nProcess\ncreated\nM04_STAL4290_09_GE_C04.indd   183 5/2/17   4:38 PM\n184  CHAPTER  4 / T HREADS\nFigure 4.5a illustrates the pure ULT approach.

Any application can be programmed \nto be multithreaded by using a threads library, which is a package of routines for ULT management. The threads library contains code for creating and destroying threads, for passing messages and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution, and for saving and restoring thread contexts.\nBy default, an application begins with a single thread and begins running in \nthat thread. This application and its thread are allocated to a single process man-aged by the kernel. At any time that the application is running (the process is in the Running state), the application may spawn a new thread to run within the same process. Spawning is done by invoking the spawn utility in the threads library. Con-trol is passed to that utility by a procedure call. The threads library creates a data structure for the new thread and then passes control to one of the threads within this process that is in the Ready state, using some scheduling algorithm. When control is passed to the library, the context of the current thread is saved, and when control is passed from the library to a thread, the context of that thread is restored. The context essentially consists of the contents of user registers, the program counter, and stack pointers.\nAll of the activity described in the preceding paragraph takes place in user \nspace and within a single process. The kernel is unaware of this activity. The ker -\nnel continues to schedule the process as a unit and assigns a single execution state (Ready, Running, Blocked, etc.) to that process. The following examples should clarify the relationship between thread scheduling and process scheduling. Suppose process B is executing in its thread 2; the states of the process and two ULTs that are part of the process are shown in Figure 4.6a.

In a single-threaded process model (i.e., there \nis no distinct concept of thread), the representation of a process includes its process control block and user address space, as well as user and kernel stacks to manage the call/return behavior of the execution of the process.

When one thread alters an item of data in memory, other threads see the results if and when they access that item. If one thread opens a file with read privileges, other threads in the same process can also read from that file.\nThe key benefits of threads derive from the performance implications:\n1.\n It\n takes far less time to create a new thread in an existing process, than to create \na brand-new process. Studies done by the Mach developers show that thread creation is ten times faster than process creation in UNIX [TEVA87].\n2.\n It tak\nes less time to terminate a thread than a process.\n3.\n It tak\nes less time to switch between two threads within the same process than \nto switch between processes.\n4.\n T\nhreads enhance efficiency in communication between different executing \nprograms.

However, because threads within the same process share memory and files, they can communicate with each other without invoking the kernel.\nThus, if there is an application or function that should be implemented as a set \nof related units of execution, it is far more efficient to do so as a collection of threads, \nrather than a collection of separate processes.\nAn example of an application that could make use of threads is a file server. As \neach new file request comes in, a new thread can be spawned for the file management program. Because a server will handle many requests, many threads will be created and destroyed in a short period. If the server runs on a multiprocessor computer, then multiple threads within the same process can be executing simultaneously on different processors. Further, because processes or threads in a file server must share file data and therefore coordinate their actions, it is faster to use threads and shared memory than processes and message passing for this coordination.\nThe thread construct is also useful on a single processor to simplify the structure \nof a program that is logically doing several different functions.\n[LETW88] gives four examples of the uses of threads in a single-user multipro-\ncessing system:\n1.\n F\noreground and background work: For example, in a spreadsheet program, one \nthread could display menus and read user input, while another thread executes user commands and updates the spreadsheet. This arrangement often increases the perceived speed of the application by allowing the program to prompt for the next command before the previous command is complete.\n2.\n Asynchr\nonous processing: Asynchronous elements in the program can be \nimplemented as threads. For example, as a protection against power failure, one can design a word processor to write its random access memory (RAM) \nM04_STAL4290_09_GE_C04.indd   180 5/2/17   4:38 PM\n4.1 / PROCESSES AND THREADS   181\nbuffer to disk once every minute.

On a multiprocessor system, mul-tiple threads from the same process may be able to execute simultaneously. Thus, even though one thread may be blocked for an I/O operation to read in a batch of data, another thread may be executing.\n4.\n Modular pr\nogram structure: Programs that involve a variety of activities or a \nvariety of sources and destinations of input and output may be easier to design and implement using threads.\nIn an OS that supports threads, scheduling and dispatching is done on a thread \nbasis; hence, most of the state information dealing with execution is maintained \nin thread-level data structures. There are, however, several actions that affect all of the threads in a process, and that the OS must manage at the process level. For example, suspension involves swapping the address space of one process out of main memory to make room for the address space of another process. Because all threads in a process share the same address space, all threads are suspended at the same time. Similarly, termination of a process terminates all threads within that process.\nThread Functionality\nLike processes, threads have execution states and may synchronize with one another. We look at these two aspects of thread functionality in turn.\nThread  STaTeS  As with processes, the key states for a thread are Running, Ready, \nand Blocked. Generally, it does not make sense to associate suspend states with threads because such states are process-level concepts. In particular, if a process is swapped out, all of its threads are necessarily swapped out because they all share the address space of the process.\nThere are four basic thread operations associated with a change in thread state \n[ANDE04]:\n1.\n Spa\nwn: Typically,", "doc_id": "d4aa0411-ac3e-48a0-8234-5174c9c56bc5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b705880d3db1a535db4d34a2a22d5097f6ed4bef0d1896e6ef601030251fc61e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 17696, "end": 19777}, "relationships": {"1": "aebb7a33-e82a-4ead-b5c0-990d48abd038", "2": "bd26671e-7f3a-4558-8454-697f41d4e32c", "3": "dba1645b-55a4-4b91-ba52-29551d402dc1"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dba1645b-55a4-4b91-ba52-29551d402dc1": {"text": "in thread state \n[ANDE04]:\n1.\n Spa\nwn: Typically, when a new process is spawned, a thread for that process \nis also spawned.
